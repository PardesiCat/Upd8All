### Upd8All üîÑ

Upd8All is a multi-purpose package updater tool that streamlines the process of keeping packages updated on Arch Linux. With support for Pacman, Yay, and Homebrew, Upd8All automatically handles superuser privileges when needed and notifies the user about important updates, such as the "gh" version in Homebrew. Simplify your life by keeping your system up to date with just one command.

<sub>* This is currently an experimental phase where the primary focus is on making the system functional and establishing a practical and logical pathway that aligns with both my vision and the project's goals. It might contain errors, bugs, etc. Many other non-core elements of the project are considered secondary.</sub>
